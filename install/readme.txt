----------(Ex-D)------------

So you've mastered the traditional, pencil and paper game of 'noughts and crosses', sometimes called 'Tig Tag Toe'. Now try your hand at the bind-boggling 3D version...
-----First!-----
Make shore you have the newest version of Direct X installed. A Direct X 3D graphics card is recommended.



-----Keys-----
Pieces that are placed, always go in to the closest grid to you. This makes the view keys very important when placing your pieces.

View Keys: Arrow Keys

Placement Keys: Num-pad keys

            Eg:     7 | 8 | 9
                   -----------
                    4 | 5 | 6
                   -----------
                    1 | 2 | 3
